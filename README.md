# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I have created a responsive weather app website using React JS and the OpenWeatherMap API. This project utilizes JavaScript and React. The app can fetch weather data such as temperature, humidity, real feel, wind speed, visibility, and local time for a specified location. Users are able to search for a city by entering text or use their current location for the search.
